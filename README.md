# My Dotfiles
These are files to configure a shell just the way I like it using [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/). It's a fork of [Erik Michaels-Ober](https://github.com/sferik)'s [dotfiles](https://github.com/sferik/dotfiles). I can't recommend his work highly enough.

## Installation
    brew install fish
    git clone git://github.com/atogle/dotfiles
    cd dotfiles
    ./install.fish
