# My Dotfiles
These are files to configure a shell just the way I like it. It's a fork of
[Erik Michaels-Ober](https://github.com/sferik)'s
[dotfiles](https://github.com/sferik/dotfiles). I can't recommend his work 
highly enough.

Also, if you managed to make it this far without ever reading [In the Beginning was
the Command Line](http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html), stop whatever
you're doing and read that instead.

## Installation
    gem install thor
    git clone git://github.com/sferik/dotfiles
    cd dotfiles
    thor dotfiles:install
